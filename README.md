## üìå Abstract
This project focuses on building a **Wireless Indoor Localization system** that predicts a user‚Äôs position indoors using **WiFi signal strengths** from multiple access points ‚Äî an area where GPS-based methods fail.  

It is my **first public machine learning project**, where I implemented and compared different classification algorithms. For each model, multiple hyperparameters were tuned, and the best-performing configuration was selected to generate results such as confusion matrices and accuracy scores.

## üß† Description
The project implements and evaluates the following **machine learning classifiers**:
- k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  
- Gradient Boosting  

Key highlights:
- Applied **GridSearchCV** for hyperparameter tuning.  
- Performed **comparative analysis** between models to highlight performance trade-offs.  
- Achieved **~96% accuracy** with **Random Forest**, supported by confusion matrix and heatmap visualizations.  
- Conducted **EDA** to analyze WiFi signal distributions across different rooms.
